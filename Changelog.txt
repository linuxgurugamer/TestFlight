Brakes breaking
Both types of steering breaking (in different ways, because they are very different by nature)
Motors burning
Still not ideal. Staging dependency looks silly for rovers without staging (so you can't get data without having a decoupler on rover).
Example config is not included.
Repairing is not tested just because can't invoke repairs in any way.
